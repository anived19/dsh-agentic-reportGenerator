"""
Chief Editor: single-shot synthesis call. No tools, no autonomy, no
multi-turn loop — deliberately not agentic.

There's no decision left to make at this stage: Market Data and Sentiment
Findings have already been fetched and validated. Giving this stage tool
access or iterative autonomy would only add a surface for it to restate a
number incorrectly, with no corresponding benefit. It reads the two
validated JSON objects and produces Markdown — nothing more.

The report_type parameter controls which sections the Chief Editor is
instructed to include. Section ordering is now driven by render_config.yaml
rather than hardcoded strings — adding a new section or changing order
requires only an edit to that config file, not a code change here.
