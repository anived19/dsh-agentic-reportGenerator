  Trigger this skill when you need to understand, extend, or debug the
  AML/ABC compliance screening layer (Layer 2). Covers: which data sources
  are screened, what each source covers, how to add a new source, how
  entities are derived, severity classification logic, and known data gaps.

# Skill: AML / ABC Screening Layer

## When to activate this skill
Load this skill when:
- You need to add a new screening data source
- You need to understand how entities are selected for screening
- You need to adjust severity classification thresholds
- You need to debug a failing screening source
- You need to understand what the --aml flag does and doesn't cover

## Discovery scope: workspace (not global)

This skill lives at `.agents/skills/aml-abc-screening/` — workspace scope.
It is project-specific (references this project's schemas, source list, and
config) and should not be globally available.

## Severity classification

### Structured sources (Phase 1)
| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 None | Source searched, no name match found |
| 🟡 Watch | API/network error — screening incomplete; manual check needed |
| 🟠 Elevated | Partial name match or presence in secondary lists (OpenSanctions, UN, EU) |
| 🔴 High | Confirmed presence on OFAC SDN or World Bank debarment list |

### Adverse media (Phase 2)
Severity is classified by keyword presence in the retrieved content:
- **High:** "sanctioned", "convicted", "indicted", "money laundering", "wilful default"
- **Elevated:** "SEBI order", "bribery", "corruption", "FCPA", "SFO investigation", "fraud"
- **Watch:** Any result returned from an AML query that doesn't hit the above keywords

---

## How to add a new screening source

1. **Implement a screener function** in `tools/aml_tools.py`:
   ```python
   def screen_new_source(entity_name: str) -> AMLFinding:
       # fetch, match, return AMLFinding(...)
   ```
2. **Add it to `screeners` list** in `tools/aml_tools.py:run_structured_aml_sweep()`.
3. **Document it** in the source reference table above and in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. **Update `render_config.yaml`** section_specs if the source warrants a config entry.
